Chapter 4 — Human–Robot Interaction (HRI)

Meta Description:
This chapter discusses design principles and communication frameworks enabling safe, intuitive, and effective interaction between humans and humanoid robots.

H2: Communication Modalities in HRI

Robots communicate via speech, gesture recognition, body language interpretation, and screen interfaces. Multimodal systems increase clarity and user trust.

H3: Safety Protocols and Emotional Intelligence

Humanoids must predict human intentions and adjust behavior to maintain safety. Emotional AI modules interpret facial expressions and tone to improve social engagement.

H4: Collaboration and Task Sharing

Shared autonomy systems allow humans and robots to perform tasks jointly. Robots assist by adapting force, trajectory, or timing based on human cues.
