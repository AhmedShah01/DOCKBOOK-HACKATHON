Chapter 1 — Foundations of Physical AI

Meta Description:
This chapter introduces the core principles of Physical AI, covering embodied intelligence, interaction mechanics, and the fundamental differences between digital AI and physically grounded AI.

H2: Understanding Embodied Intelligence

Physical AI focuses on systems whose intelligence emerges through interaction with the physical world. Unlike digital AI confined to data, embodied intelligence processes feedback from sensors, actuators, and real-time environments.

H3: Physical Constraints and Computational Models

Robots must reason under constraints such as friction, gravity, inertia, and mechanical limits. Computational models fuse classical control theory with modern machine learning to adapt in dynamic environments.

H4: Differences Between Virtual AI and Physical AI

Virtual AI operates on symbolic or statistical reasoning. Physical AI combines perception, motor control, and real-world physics, requiring robust error tolerance and adaptive behavior.
