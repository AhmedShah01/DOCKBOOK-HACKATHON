Chapter 2 — Humanoid Robotics Architecture

Meta Description:
This chapter explores the structural, mechanical, and electronic architecture of humanoid robots, emphasizing design choices that enable human-like motion and interaction.

H2: Mechanical Structure and Actuator Systems

Humanoid robots mimic the human musculoskeletal system using servo motors, hydraulic systems, or artificial muscles. Actuator precision determines the quality of gait, balance, and manipulation.

H3: Sensor Ecosystem for Human-like Perception

Vision sensors, LiDAR, tactile skins, and inertial measurement units allow robots to perceive depth, touch, and orientation. Sensor fusion algorithms convert raw data into actionable insights.

H4: Control Loops and Motion Planning

Closed-loop control enables robots to maintain stability and execute smooth movements. Motion planning incorporates inverse kinematics, trajectory generation, and collision avoidance.
