Chapter 3 — Learning Algorithms for Physical AI

Meta Description:
This chapter examines machine learning methods used in humanoid robotics, including reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and adaptive control strategies.

H2: Reinforcement Learning for Motor Skills

Robots learn by trial and error through reward-based systems. RL enables mastery of locomotion, grasping, and balancing in unpredictable conditions.

H3: Imitation Learning for Demonstration-Based Training

Humanoids observe human motion via sensors or recordings and replicate behaviors using supervised learning. This reduces training time and aligns robots with natural human movement styles.

H4: Adaptive and Hybrid Learning Models

Combining model-based and data-driven approaches yields robust controllers capable of real-time adaptation to new terrains, objects, and tasks.
